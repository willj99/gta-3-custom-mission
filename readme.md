# What is Interception?
Interception is a faux-custom mission for Grand Theft Auto III, I say faux-custom mission because it isn't defined via Main.scm, but it emulates the experience of a custom mission 100%. 

This mission is also a seperate script, not contributing to the game's statistics.

# Installation
Playing interception requires the CLEO library for Grand Theft Auto III, you can get it here (https://cleo.li)
- Drag and drop the contents of the archive to your CLEO folder.
- Head to the marker in Staunton by the Casino to play the mission.

# What knowledge can I get out of this?
- This mission shows how a healthbar can be successfully implemented for a boss fight in Grand Theft Auto III.
- Interception also demonstrates failure conditions, and how to emulate the experience of a mission via cutscenes, fade-in/fade-out and the correct lettering styles. 
- A lot of GTA III's opcodes and operations are interchangable with Vice City
