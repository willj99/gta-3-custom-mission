#What is Interception?
Interception is a faux-custom mission for Grand Theft Auto III. I say faux-custom mission because it isn't defined via Main.scm but it emulates the experience of a custom mission 100%, and is part of a seperate script, not contributing to the game's statistics.

#Installation
Requires the CLEO library for Grand Theft Auto III, you can get it here (https://cleo.li)
- Drag and drop the contents of the archive to your CLEO folder.
- Head to the marker in Staunton by the Casino to play the mission.
